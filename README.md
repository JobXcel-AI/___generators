# Generators

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to your project directory by running `cd your/project/path` then clone the generator scripts via `git clone https://github.com/robmllze/___generators.git`.
1. Modify the generators as needed. You may also wish to change the generator templates to suit your needs.
1. Run any of the generator scripts via `dart ___generators/<GENERATOR>.dart` where `<GENERATOR>` can be any of the included generators, like `dart generate_models.dart`.
1. Consider setting up keyboard shortcuts or single-click actions to quickly run the generators and enhance your workflow efficiency. For instance, in VS Code, you can configure a task to execute the generators. Learn more: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks.
